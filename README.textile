h1. RubyOnRails.codaplugin

RubyOnRails.codaplugin is a simple Plug-In (created with "Coda Plug-In Creator":http://panic.com/coda/developer/howto/plugins.php) that uses a few super ultra simple ruby scripts to try to bring some of the missing keyboard shortcuts in Coda for basic Ruby On Rails development.

h2. Usage

h3. Installation

Simply check out this repo into either <code>~/Library/Application Support/Coda/Plug-ins</code>, be sure to name the directory <code>RubyOnRails.mode</code> and then restart Coda.

h3. Commands

Right now there's a very simple set of shortcuts

- Typing { will insert {} with the cursor in between
- Typing ( will do the same with ()
- Hitting ^L (Ctrl L) will insert "=>"
- Hitting ^3 or ^# (Ctrl 3 or Ctrl #) will insert #{}

* Sadly coda doesn't have keyboard triggers, AFAIK, so I had to use ^3 :(
